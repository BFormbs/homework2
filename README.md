For this assignment I made a responsive webpage about myself using html, css and bootstrap. I tried my best to exactly replicate the example images that were provided. I used a navbar that remains the same throughout each page, made the code semantic so its easier for other programmers to understand and much more. I used cards for every page and used my knowledge of css to customize them accordingly. I put background photos in each card and even put cards within other cards. I had a hidden gem if you click my name;) something for the treasure hunters to admire you might say. Hope you enjoy I had a good amount of fun making this page!
